# Grow
The healthy engineering engineering organization prioritizes the growth of its individuals and teams. Beyond the broad strokes of what the larger company offers, it’s necessary to standardize the foundation on which individuals, their managers and their teams can build a growth strategy. 

Being able to clearly define the organizational focus and approach to individual personal and professional growth is also a useful recruiting tool: as an engineering manager, you want to attract talent that seeks to grow; and as such, be able to clearly describe the structure within which your organization will support the potential hire’s growth. 

As a potential or existing hire in an engineering org, you want to know that the engineering culture has the desire and infrastructure to support whatever growth plans you’re nursing. It should go without saying, but: stagnation will be the death of your career and earning prospects. 

In senior management, wide variances in the growth patterns and structures in the engineering organization leads to 

- Uneven performances
- Unequally challenged staff
- Poor morale
- Stagnant innovation pipeline
- Stagnant leadership pipeline

Growth has many different outcomes, motivations and meanings; but like the Build pillar, it has a fixed set of components:

 ### 1. [Goals](goals.md)
 ### 2. [Opportunities](opportunities.md)
 ### 3. [Supporting Tools](grow-tools.md)

## Measurement

Measuring the growth of individuals or teams is decidedly more cumbersome than we can get with the build pillar, but it can be done. A quantitative analysis should show that 

- Goals and Opportunities are being created across the organization
- Goals and Opportunities are provided in timely fashion
- Goals and Opportunities are acknowledged by their targets
- Goals and opportunities are being tracked by the broader human resources organization
- Specific categories of goals and opportunities that are high priority are being created 
- The resources of the engineering organization being expended specifically for growth opportunities
- Goals and opportunities can be clearly aligned and correlated with larger strategic initiatives when available
- Specific conversations have been had around the set goals and opportunities
