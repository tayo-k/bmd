# Management

### TL;DR: Be an active participant in supporting your engineers and the organization

Where the engineers own the _how_ of building product, engineering leadership owns the _what_. 

In supporting the engineers, partners, customers and the product, be prepared to actively engage the levers available to you.

## Active Leadership
The active leader takes deliberate, calibrated steps to deliver specific outcomes on a regular basis.

If you're looking forward to any outcome in your directs, partners, or your organization, ask the question:

What am I doing on a regular basis to elicit this outcome I desire? 

This should not be construed as a mechanism to micromanage. Rather, it involves the *measured* application of  pre-determined levers available only to the leadership cadre of the organization

###The Guardrail Paradox and Active Leadership 
Where active leadership encourages deliberate engagement and use of *leadership* tools and instruments, it may not be sustainable over a long enough period of time.

This is where guardrails come in.

Active leadership engages in the deliberate and systematic installation of guardrails around their organization. These guardrails are systems and processes that help automate or otherwise safeguard the qualities they wish to sustain in the organization.

By deploying well managed guardrails, an active leader can then transition into a more passive leadership in certain aspects; the well managed guardrails and quality gates should assume more responsibility in safeguarding parts of the engineering culture.
