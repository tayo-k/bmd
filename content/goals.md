Goals
======

We define goals as specific, measurable, achievable , relevant and time-bound (SMART) targets that 

- All parties involved agree to
- All parties involved understand the target and purpose of the goals
- Are documented in a reasonable timeframe ahead of their relevance

### What’s in it for me?

Originating goals is a fairly broad subject, so we won’t address sources of goals here. 

Rather, we will address the motivations for goals. Goal setting conversation should center only around the following three notes:

1. **Self Goals**: Goals that directly benefit the employee first. It stands to reason that a growth goal for the employee benefits the organization eventually. A conversation on this category of goals should focus on what interests the employee first; or will be of most immediate and direct benefit to the employee at first. 

2. **Team Goals**: Goals that directly benefit the supervisor’s organization first. These are goals that if achieved, stand to benefit the smallest unit of organization that the executor of the goal belongs to - their team. It stands to reason here as well that an effective goal will indirectly yield growth to the employee as well. The first beneficiary of this category of goals should be the team.

3. **Organizational Goals**: These are goals that transcend the individual and their team; benefiting a wider group of teams or the organization at large. These could be larger efforts and opportunities for improving efficiencies or innovation. 

A longer period of time, like an appraisal year, should feature examples of all three goals; documented and factored into the employee’s periodical review. These goals should be separate and in addition to the expected day-to-day deliverables of the executor’s job function.
