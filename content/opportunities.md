Opportunities
=============

We define opportunities as specific, measurable and relevant avenues and resources made available to individuals to deliver goals of any kind, for any motivation (self, team, organization). Because, what good are goals if there’s neither the time, support or resources to deliver them? Opportunities should be

- Clearly documented and communicated to interested parties
- Clearly correlated with or linked to specific goals

The term “Opportunity” here is purposefully broad, but it’s specific in meaning anything that can be documented as being relevant in helping to achieve a goal. For example:

- A timely conversation with a mentor or supervisor
- A project that will allow an individual demonstrate or work to acquire a specific skill
- Time in a sprint to study, train or practice
- Training or subject matter education

These are all within the control of individuals of authority in the engineering organization. They can be recorded, analyzed and correlated with specific growth objectives for an individual or team.
Opportunities and corresponding goals should be mated in good faith, with the buy-in and understanding of all parties involved.
