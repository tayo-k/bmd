# Engineering Comfort
The engineering organization must be able to prioritize and clearly outline the ingredients that are relevant to achieving the comfort of the individuals creating the product. Removing obstacles to delivery – both tangible and intangible – is a key ingredient to maintaining a healthy engineering culture.

## “Happy developer, happy life”
The ease and comfort with which engineers and related disciplines can do their job directly affects the quality of the output, as well as the health of the overall engineering culture and organization. 

A healthy engineering culture must be able to define and observe specific ingredients targeted solely at the comfort of the individuals responsible for creating the product. 

Reducing or eliminating the friction experienced by the engineering organization in the course of generating the product must be addressed on an ongoing basis.
It is **crucial** that the engineers be allowed to drive this conversation, instead of management making assumptions first. 

As different engineering organizations have different pain points (and budgets) with which to address this pillar, we will not be prescribing specific tactical items here. We will describe structures and processes within which an organization can address more specific details.

### Pods
Otherwise known as guilds in various parts of the industry. A pod is a group of subject-matter interested individuals in the organization. For example, a Front-End pod will be composed of individuals that are either experts or interested in the matters concerning the front-end components of the product; a Security pod will be composed of individuals interested in security matters affecting the product.

- A pod will cross the boundaries of functional teams, or other 	traditional reporting structures. 
- A pod will bring together like-minded individuals across the engineering organization, to collaborate in tight-knit groups that are passionate about a specific subject matter. No management or authority figures should participate in these pods.
- A pod will meet on a regular basis to deliberate and ideate on how to address De-risking and Engineering Comfort, as it concerns their subject matter. No management or authority figures should participate in these sessions.
- A pod should use the BMD grid or similar structure to clearly outline their ideas and plans as they concern the subject matter. 	
- A pod should self-designate Points-of-Contact. The PoCs will serve as an interface to the pod for management, and other pods. These aren’t individuals with authority over anyone else in the pod; they’re simply representatives of the pods they participate in.
- A pod should be empowered to define work they deem necessary to further the objectives of De-risking and Engineering Comfort. The work should be well-defined and estimated by the pod, for level of effort and resources.	 	
- Work output from the pods should remain clearly aligned with any strategic objectives of the larger engineering organization.

Pods provide a structure for engineers to freely ideate, experiment and coalesce around efforts that can be linked to strategic objectives.

They are an avenue for engineers to provide bottom-up leadership to their supervisors.

### Milestones
Smaller units of work defined or produced by pods should be grouped together and organized under milestones. Milestones (or themes) are coherent, measurable and time-bound goals that smaller units of work build up to. Milestones should be demonstrably linked to any larger strategic initiatives, if they exist. A milestone serves as an uplink to strategic targets and initiatives, from the work the pods are doing. The goal is to give non-management individuals ownership and stake in the culture of their organizations, as well as strategic goals of senior management

### Steering Group
A steering group should consist of middle management and other stakeholders with access to resources. These are the individuals that will be able to

- Mentor individuals in a pod 	
- Remove obstacles to milestones
- Share context across the broader organization 	
- Allocate time and resources to tasks and milestones defined by pods
- Help keep milestones aligned with larger strategic objectives and key results

With these structures in place, we arrive at a process where
- Pods ideate and craft milestones they’re interested in picking up
- They work with the steering group to allocate time and resources to the milestones
- Continuously deliver milestones based on needs they’ve identified, under the guidance of their steering group.
