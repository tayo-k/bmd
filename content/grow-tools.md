Supporting Tools
================= 
In support of growth an engineering organization, the organization will apply different variations of these tools:

## Stretch Goals

“In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence” - Laurence J. Peter

A healthy engineering culture must actively guard against saddling individuals or teams with responsibility they have not been adequately prepared for. The Peter Principle is the enemy, but also a yardstick to gauge growth prospects.

With carefully curated goals and opportunities to deliver on those goals, the healthy engineering culture can objectively assess an individual’s readiness to accept more responsibility. Providing opportunities to deliver goals beyond the individual’s current rank is a way to prepare the individual for increased responsibility. These are generally referred to as “stretch goals” in the industry. 

## Timely Communication
You can not grow - or even run - an engineering culture, or its organization without timely and effective communication. Eliminating friction up and down the reporting chain of the organization should be a core value of any engineering culture. These structured feedback opportunities should be provided as basics:

1. **1-on-1**

    The 1-on-1 meeting is the foundational unit of communication between an individual and their direct supervisor. This should be in addition to any other more immediate communications between the two. We define the basic 1-on-1 as having the following minimum characteristics:
    - Held on a pre-arranged, regular basis
    - Primarily focused on the needs of the employee
    - Primarily focused on goals and opportunities
    - Obligated to provide psychological safety of the individual
2. **Skip-Level**
   
    The skip-level is a conversation between an individual and supervisors above their immediate supervisor - skipping any number of levels in the chain of responsibility. This skip in levels affords the employee the opportunity to communicate with more senior members of the engineering organization. Management in turn is provided more direct access to insights and intelligence regarding the functioning of their organization. This conversation is
    - Held on a pre-arranged, regular basis
    - Still primarily focused on the needs of the employee
3. **All-hands**
   
    The all-hands (or any similarly named conversation) is an opportunity for a cross-section of the engineering organization (scaled as necessary) to communicate on matters that affect the broader engineering organization. It provides an opportunity to
    - Share larger contexts
    - Communicate vision and strategy
    - Communicate priorities
    - Access other members of the organization that may be otherwise inaccessible
4. **Dead-Letter**
    
    The dead letter drop is a communication mechanism that should be available as a mechanism of last resort. This mechanism offers a feedback avenue 
    - For individuals that don’t feel comfortable speaking with authority figures face-to-face
    - To provide feedback that may be difficult to provide directly to, or about their intended targets. 

## Positive Feedback Loop
A great culture produces a great product. The satisfaction of delivering a great product feeds back into a great culture. 

Individuals that _want_ to come in every day and continue to collaborate and create a great product, are the outcome of a great culture. 

The management of the engineering organization has the greater responsibility of fostering an ecosystem that

- Celebrates goals and milestones hit
- Rewards individual or team service that goes above and beyond the normal calls of duty
- Generally sustains a joyful mood, even if "for no obvious reason"
- Incentivizes a self-sustaining drive to continue to excel and innovate

Difficult times are bound to occur for both individuals and teams, both forseable and not. A pre-existing, sustained environment of positivity, camaraderie, mental and emotional stability make challenging times much less trying for the organization as a whole. 

Directly (and publicly, where appropriate) engineering a positive feedback loop in the engineering organization strengthens the resolve and bonds within the team, to continue to deliver.
