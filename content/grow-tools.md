Supporting Tools
================= 
In support of growth an engineering organization, the organization will apply different variations of these tools:

##Stretch Goals
“In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence” - Laurence J. Peter

A healthy engineering culture must actively guard against saddling individuals or teams with responsibility they have not been adequately prepared for. The Peter Principle is the enemy, but also a yardstick to gauge growth prospects 
With carefully curated goals and opportunities to deliver on those goals, the healthy engineering culture can objectively assess an individual’s readiness to accept more responsibility. Providing opportunities to deliver goals beyond the individual’s current rank is a way to prepare the individual for increased responsibility. These are generally referred to as “stretch goals” in the industry. 

##Timely Feedback
You can not grow - or even run - an engineering culture, or its organization without timely and effective feedback. Eliminating friction up and down the reporting chain of the organization should be a core value of any engineering organization. These structured feedback opportunities should be provided as basics:

1. **1-on-1**

    The 1-on-1 meeting is the foundational unit of communication between an individual and their direct supervisor. This should be in addition to any other more immediate communications between the two. We define the basic 1-on-1 as having the following minimum characteristics:
    - Held on a pre-arranged, regular basis
    - Primarily focused on the needs of the employee
    - Primarily focused on goals and opportunities
2. **Skip-Level**
   
    The skip-level is a conversation between an individual and supervisors above their immediate supervisor - skipping any number of levels in the chain of responsibility. This skip in levels affords the employee the opportunity to communicate with more senior members of the engineering organization. Management in turn is provided more direct access to insights and intelligence regarding the functioning of their organization. This conversation is
    - Held on a pre-arranged, regular basis
    - Still primarily focused on the needs of the employee
3. **All-hands**
   
    The all-hands (or any similarly named conversation) is an opportunity for a cross-section of the engineering organization (scaled as necessary) to communicate on matters that affect the broader engineering organization. It provides an opportunity to
    - Share larger contexts
    - Communicate vision and strategy
    - Communicate priorities
    - Access other members of the organization that may be otherwise inaccessible
4. **Dead-Letter**
    
    The dead letter drop is a communication mechanism that should be available as a mechanism of last resort. This mechanism offers a feedback avenue 
    - For individuals that don’t feel comfortable speaking with authority figures face-to-face
    - To provide feedback that may be difficult to provide directly to, or about their intended targets.
