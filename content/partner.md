### TL;DR: Enable your partners and delight your customers

Customers and partners are the two different categories of organizations that the engineering organization is accountable to. Their expectations and impacts on the culture are also different.

## Mutual Enablement Partnerships

In a partnership, the partners

1. Make one another's expectations known well in advance
2. Actively work to support each other's needs
3. Hold each other accountable to their expectations
4. Exercise goodwill and patience toward each other
5. Have the same goal: delighting the customer

Your engineering culture should forge mutually enabling partnerships, aligned toward delighting your customers.
