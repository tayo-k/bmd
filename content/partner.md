### TL;DR: Prioritize and sustain transparency, expectations and boundaries with your partners


The engineering organization will need to coordinate efforts and resources with other groups within the enterprise to successfully deliver product on time and to specification. The **Partner** guardrail defines the basis on which the BMD engineering organization collaborates with other organizations and resources within the enterprise.

Within the BMD framework, we deliberately identify “customers” and “partners” as distinct categories of entities. This distinction is important:

- **Customers**: have minimal obligations to the engineering organization. They put out demands and expectations and generally require them met. Because “The customer is always right”. Their motivations and goals are fundamentally different from that of the engineering organization’s. Customers work **on** the engineering organization to extract output, and leave until the next time they need output. They are **involved** in the process. A customer has a choice of whom they patronize.
- **Partners**: are working **with** the engineering organization toward common goals. In a partnership, the partners are mutually obligated to each other to deliver the product. There are expectations of each partner that are communicated and agreed upon in advance. When these expectations aren’t met, there is accountability and adjustments made to maintain alignment. Partners are integrated into the process of engineering at different stages. Partners are **committed** in the process.

The engineering organization must be able to clearly identify and differentiate their customers from their partners. The impact of customers on the culture of the organization is very different from that of partners.

Customers in general, exert pressure on the engineering culture. They would typically be in a position of power over the engineering organization and would be dictating demands, timelines and financial incentives. They are also largely unaccountable to the engineering organization; they have options of whom to patronize, and thus can take their business elsewhere. 

The risks of feature pressure, products of questionable quality and developer burnout are real; especially when the engineering culture erroneously relates with too many others as customers, instead of partners. 

A partner with an engineering organization provides:
- Accountability
- Documented expectations of the engineering organization
- Documented timings of these expectations
- Agreement with the partner and its management

A healthy partnership rests on a mutually accountable relationship where there are no unpleasant surprises and there is timely transparency on all matters.

Specifically, we will address the relationship with the business (or product) organization with regard to a healthy engineering culture

### Partnership With Business

“Business pays the bills” is a popular refrain - and it’s true. The other side of that equation is that engineering keeps the building standing. For a healthy engineering culture, an equitable, almost affectionate partnership should be forged with the business organization.
 
 The business organization that’s treated like a partner provides the following services:

1. **Timely Context**
    
    The business should provide the _why_ as well as the _what_ of their requirements to the engineering organization well ahead of when the feature development should actually start. Understanding the context surrounding business requirements allows the engineering group to provide sound technical guidance; design high-quality, robust and scalable solutions; and manage risk.

2. **Scope Management**

    The engineering organisation should work with the business to plan ahead; to commit to an estimated volume and type of requirements that will be expected of the engineering organization. Sharing this plan within a predetermined time frame allows the engineering organization to plan their resource utilization and manpower allocations. It allows them to reliably forecast delivery dates and minimize the risk of burnout and engineer dissatisfaction. This also allows for a buffer to cater for incidentals and unforeseen circumstances like production issues, changes in the business landscape etc. Engineers should be able to predict what they will be working on for a predefined range of time. 

3. **High Definition Requirements**

    The engineering organization should work with the business organization to define quality standards that apply to business requirements. Clarity of purpose, completeness of information is absolutely crucial to minimize the risk of misunderstood and mistranslated business requirements. It’s to everyone’s benefit if specific minimums are always presented as part of feature requests. 

4. **Prioritized Roadmap**

    The engineering organization should support the business’s efforts to estimate and prioritize a longer term roadmap of features and other business requirements. Predictability is always welcome in the engineering organization; Any efforts to support it should be provided.

5. **Technical Debt Literacy**

    The business organization should be open to understanding the business value of initiatives originating from the engineering organization. While we can’t expect the business to consume technical material; or to understand the details surrounding specific technical debt or innovation; we should expect the business to be open to negotiating dedicated capacity for paying down technical debt.
    
    
 These are offerings that require the active participation and support of management in both organizations. 
 
 Core engineering individuals should actively advocate for their management to secure these assurances; as well as ongoing safeguards to ensure that the agreements are being upheld. The expectations should be documented and used to support activities such as:
 
 - PI Planning
 - Sprint Planning
 - Backlog Grooming

On the part of the engineering organization, they should also be obligated to provide

1. **Timely Communication**

    The organization must provide ample opportunity for the business partners to weigh in on matters that affect delivery of the product. Providing a transparent and open communication path between the engineers and the business is an obligation. Likewise, the engineering org should be available to provide input when needed for planning purposes by the business. 

2. **Prioritized Technical Debt** 

    The organization should maintain an estimated and prioritized list of technical debt items. This list should be readily available for review by the business partners, complete with necessary context. 

3. **Technical Debt Context**

    The organization should always supply context related to any technical debt or innovation being worked on. This should include the demonstrable business value of the work, as well as any connection to strategic initiatives. 

4. **Transparent Capacity Plans**

    The organization should always be ready to provide reasonable estimates of available delivery capacity, within a reasonable timeframe. This is in everyone's interests for planning and forecasting purposes.
