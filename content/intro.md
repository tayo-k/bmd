Better Managed Development
===========================

## TL;DR

1. Give your engineers ownership of the way your product is built
2. Prioritize and measure managing risk in your product and process
3. Prioritize and measure your engineers’ comfort
4. Prioritize and measure the sustainable growth of your individuals and teams
5. Prioritize and sustain transparency, expectations and boundaries with your partners

The industry has decided on standards and frameworks to describe and define the ways software products should be built. 

There is no shortage of frameworks that determine how employees should be “managed”. 

The focus is usually on the output of engineering organizations; how code should be written; how projects should be managed. 

There are shorthand phrases that readily describe how any software engineering shop delivers a product. 

Most don’t know what to expect when joining or partnering with a software engineering organization. 

We haven’t tried to describe, quantify or measure the culture of the engineering organization.

## What We Define as “Engineering Culture”

"Culture", in the context of software engineering is a question of _how_, not _what_, one builds software.

This way, we can define Engineering Culture as the implementation of a set of standards, processes and practices that define _how_ we deliver software products; from concept to production deployment. 

Some specifics of culture will vary in some aspects from organization to organization; but there are universal and quantifiable guardrails that we believe are broadly applicable to any healthy engineering organization. 

Defining these guardrails is the objective of the Better Managed Development manifesto. 

This manifesto supports three broad categories of actors in the organization:

1. #### Engineering Non-management
   - Use a shorthand framework to know what a company’s engineering culture is before joining up. Everybody has expectations of you (“10X dEveLopEr”, Agile, PMP, 	Extreme Programming etc). You should have one for the culture you participate in and contribute to. 	
 	
   - Have a framework within which to understand your place in your engineering organization, understanding what you should expect from your management, peers and 	partners
 	
   - Guardrails to hold yourself, your colleagues and your organization accountable to standards and 	expectations

2. #### Engineering Management
   - Reliably and repeatably execute your strategy and deliver innovative products in a timely 	manner.
 	
   - Guardrail and protect your engineering organization’s culture.
 	
   - Be deliberate about the outcomes you want to see from middle management and beyond
 	
   - Have objective measures to gauge the state of your engineering organization and its culture.
 	
   - Codify and document the bases 	of your relationships with partners of the engineering organization

3. #### Product/Business
   - Understand the ethos and 	motivations of the engineering organization you’re partnered with
   - Partner more effectively with the organization based on a transparent and well-documented set of principles and practices.

The culture of software engineering shops has not been codified into shorthand. Engineering culture has been dependent on either a handful of enigmatic leaders’ ability to effectively foster healthy and productive engineering organizations; or a select few “brass-ring” organizations remaining the sole purveyors of healthy engineering cultures. 

When we say a shop is “Agile”, one knows exactly what to expect from that engineering organization. Operators in the software engineering industry deserve a measure of certainty, a set of principles that readily describe the culture of an engineering organization, on entering the team.

##  Why We Need To Be Deliberate About Engineering Culture

The only differences between a high-performing engineering shop and others boil down to two things:
 1. Budget
 2. Culture

For the majority of the tech industry, their budgetary constraints are not going to change drastically. Most individuals in the engineering organization don’t have control over the money available to them.

No, your ping-pong table isn’t a substitute for actual, deliberately engineered culture. Few people will be joining your team because you have a Foosball table.

No, the technology isn’t a differentiator insofar the majority of the software engineering industry thrives on open source or otherwise readily available technologies.

No, the primary differentiator for many high-performing engineering organizations is their engineering culture.

A relatively lower budget engineering organization can still execute effectively; deliver high-quality products; retain and attract great talent. All based solely on the strengths of a healthy, effective and deliberate engineering culture.

Engineering culture is the one ingredient that is uniquely within the control of the engineering organization and its participants. 

It needs to be deliberately crafted, documented, exercised and most importantly, safeguarded from other externalities to the engineering process and organization.

- We believe software engineering culture is equally as important as the actual engineering of software itself. 	
 	
- We believe a set of standards should describe some minimums that underpin a healthy, effective and sustainable software engineering organization.
 	
- We believe that engineering culture involves more than just software engineering; the relationship between engineering and the product organization business; the relationship between the engineering and the agile process; the relationship between engineering and senior management – all of these are facets relevant to a healthy engineering culture.

#### Safeguarding Engineering Culture Should Be a Distinct Responsibility
Scrum masters safeguard agile principles in the process of engineering. 

Project managers safeguard project management principles in the course of delivering the product. 

Product owners safeguard the customer and the business’s interests along the way. 

We propose the Better Managed Development (BMD) manifesto as a step in that direction. It’s our hope that this becomes an iterative standard that the industry will contribute to. There are big-budget shops that have solved cultural problems; we invite them to contribute proposals here to help seed the industry with healthy, reproducible practices.

It should be the dedicated responsibility of one or more individuals to safeguard the interests of the culture of an engineering organization. 

This responsibility will be executed along distinct, observable and measurable guardrails.

## Guardrails of Engineering Culture

1. ### [Build](build.md)
   ###### This guardrail addresses patterns and structures that safeguard how the product is built and delivered
2. ### [Grow](grow.md)
   ###### This guardrail addresses patterns and standards that support the growth of individuals and teams in the engineering organization
3. ### [Partner](partner.md)
   ###### This guardrail addresses the expectations and philosophy that influences the relationship that an engineering organization has with other organizations in the enterprise.
