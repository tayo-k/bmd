Better Managed Development
===========================
## A framework for managing engineering culture
### What We Define as “Engineering Culture”

"Culture", in the context of software engineering is a question of _how_, not _what_, one builds software.

This way, we can define Engineering Culture as the implementation of a set of standards, processes and practices that define _how_ we deliver software products; from concept to production deployment. 

Some specifics of culture will vary in some aspects from organization to organization; but there are universal and quantifiable guardrails that we believe are broadly applicable to any healthy engineering organization. 

Defining these guardrails is the objective of the Better Managed Development manifesto. 

This manifesto supports three broad categories of actors in the organization:

1. #### Engineering Non-management
   - Use a shorthand framework to know what a company’s engineering culture is before joining up. Everybody has expectations of you (“10X dEveLopEr”, Agile, PMP, 	Extreme Programming etc). You should have one for the culture you participate in and contribute to. 	
 	
   - Have a framework within which to understand your place in your engineering organization, understanding what you should expect from your management, peers and 	partners
 	
   - Guardrails to hold yourself, your colleagues and your organization accountable to standards and 	expectations

2. #### Engineering Management
   - Reliably and repeatably execute your strategy and deliver innovative products in a timely 	manner.
 	
   - Guardrail and protect your engineering organization’s culture.
 	
   - Be deliberate about the outcomes you want to see from middle management and beyond
 	
   - Have objective measures to gauge the state of your engineering organization and its culture.
 	
   - Codify and document the bases 	of your relationships with partners of the engineering organization

3. #### Product/Business
   - Understand the ethos and 	motivations of the engineering organization you’re partnered with
   - Partner more effectively with the organization based on a transparent and well-documented set of principles and practices.

The culture of software engineering shops has not been codified into shorthand. Engineering culture has been dependent on either a handful of enigmatic leaders’ ability to effectively foster healthy and productive engineering organizations; or a select few “brass-ring” organizations remaining the sole purveyors of healthy engineering cultures. 

When we say a shop is “Agile”, one knows exactly what to expect from that engineering organization. Operators in the software engineering industry deserve a measure of certainty, a set of principles that readily describe the culture of an engineering organization, on entering the team.

##  Why We Need To Be Deliberate About Engineering Culture

The only differences between a high-performing engineering shop and others boil down to two things:
 1. Budget
 2. Culture

For the majority of the tech industry, their budgetary constraints are not going to change drastically. Most individuals in the engineering organization don’t have control over the money available to them.

No, your ping-pong table isn’t a substitute for actual, deliberately engineered culture. Few people will be joining your team because you have a Foosball table.

No, the technology isn’t a differentiator insofar the majority of the software engineering industry thrives on open source or otherwise readily available technologies.

No, the primary differentiator for many high-performing engineering organizations is their engineering culture.

A relatively lower budget engineering organization can still execute effectively; deliver high-quality products; retain and attract great talent. All based solely on the strengths of a healthy, effective and deliberate engineering culture.

Engineering culture is the one ingredient that is uniquely within the control of the engineering organization and its participants. 

It needs to be deliberately crafted, documented, exercised and most importantly, safeguarded from other externalities to the engineering process and organization.

- We believe software engineering culture is equally as important as the actual engineering of software itself. 	
 	
- We believe a set of standards should describe some minimums that underpin a healthy, effective and sustainable software engineering organization.
 	
- We believe that engineering culture involves more than just software engineering; the relationship between engineering and the product organization business; the relationship between the engineering and the agile process; the relationship between engineering and senior management – all of these are facets relevant to a healthy engineering culture.

## Principles
#### 1. Engineering culture is a distinct, quantifiable quality
 ##### i. Safeguard engineering culture as a distinct responsibility
 ##### ii. Safeguard engineering culture along its guardrails
 ##### ii. Measure engineering culture along its guardrails
 ****
#### 2. [Guardrail how your product is built](build.md)
 ##### i. Engineers own how the product is built.
 ##### ii. Building the product should be as straightforward as the engineers can make it.
 ##### iii. Supporting the product should be as straightforward as the engineers can make it. 
 ##### iv. Each step that the product goes through is a quality gate
 ##### v. Guardrails protect each quality gate
 ##### vi. Shift guardrails left wherever possible and practical
 ##### vii. Automate the guardrails wherever possible and practical.
 ##### viii. Capture metrics from your guardrails wherever possible and practical.
 ##### ix. Build your product to tell you what went wrong and how.
 ##### x. Build your product to be versioned.
 ##### xi. Seek feedback from non-management; specifically on how the product is being built.

#### 3. [Guardrail how the organization grows](grow.md)
 ##### i. The engineers get documented SMART goals that align with their interests
 
 ##### ii. The engineers get documented SMART goals that align with the team's interests
 
 ##### iii. The engineers get documented SMART goals that align with the organization's interests
 
 ##### iv. The engineers get documented opportunities that directly support their documented goals
 
 ##### v. All levels of engineering management are available to receive regular feedback from non-management
 
 ##### vi. All levels of engineering management are available to provide regular, timely feedback to the non-management
 
 ##### vii. Every predefined communication opportunity between management and non-management is a quality gate
 
 ##### viii. Publicly commend; privately admonish.
 
 ##### ix. The engineers know the engineers they want to work with. Let them.
 
 ##### x. The engineers know the managers they want to work with. Let them.

#### 4. [Guardrail how the organizaton partners with others](partner.md)
 ##### i. Identify and distinguish between partners and customers of the engineering organization
 ##### ii. Dedicate specific guardrails to the benefit of your customers and partners along the engineering journey
 ##### iii. The engineers are the guardrail for the quality of feature requests
 ##### iv The business is the guardrail for the quality of the features built
 ##### v. The team is the guardrail of scope
