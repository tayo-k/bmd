Better Managed Development
===========================
## A method for managing engineering culture
### What We Define as “Engineering Culture”

"Culture", in the context of software engineering is a question of _how_, not _what_, one builds software.

This way, we can define Engineering Culture as the implementation of a set of standards, processes and practices that define _how_ we deliver software products; from concept to production deployment. 

Some specifics of culture will vary in some aspects from organization to organization; but there are universal and quantifiable guardrails that we believe are broadly applicable to any healthy engineering organization. 

Defining these guardrails is the objective of the Better Managed Development manifesto. 

This manifesto supports three broad categories of actors in the organization:

1. #### Engineering Non-management
   - Use a shorthand framework to know what a company’s engineering culture is before joining up. Everybody has expectations of you (“10X dEveLopEr”, Agile, PMP, 	Extreme Programming etc). You should have one for the culture you participate in and contribute to. 	
 	
   - Have a framework within which to understand your place in your engineering organization, understanding what you should expect from your management, peers and 	partners
 	
   - Guardrails to hold yourself, your colleagues and your organization accountable to standards and 	expectations

2. #### Engineering Management
   - Reliably and repeatably execute your strategy and deliver innovative products in a timely 	manner.
 	
   - Guardrail and protect your engineering organization’s culture.
 	
   - Be deliberate about the outcomes you want to see from middle management and beyond
 	
   - Have objective measures to gauge the state of your engineering organization and its culture.
 	
   - Codify and document the bases 	of your relationships with partners of the engineering organization

3. #### Product/Business
   - Understand the ethos and 	motivations of the engineering organization you’re partnered with
   - Partner more effectively with the organization based on a transparent and well-documented set of principles and practices.

The culture of software engineering shops has not been codified into shorthand. Engineering culture has been dependent on either a handful of enigmatic leaders’ ability to effectively foster healthy and productive engineering organizations; or a select few “brass-ring” organizations remaining the sole purveyors of healthy engineering cultures. 

When we say a shop is “Agile”, one knows exactly what to expect from that engineering organization. Operators in the software engineering industry deserve a measure of certainty, a set of principles that readily describe the culture of an engineering organization, on entering the team.

##  Why We Need To Be Deliberate About Engineering Culture

The only differences between a high-performing engineering shop and others boil down to two things:
 1. Budget
 2. Culture

For the majority of the tech industry, their budgetary constraints are not going to change drastically. Most individuals in the engineering organization don’t have control over the money available to them.

A relatively lower budget engineering organization can still execute effectively; deliver high-quality products; retain and attract great talent. All based solely on the strengths of a healthy, effective and deliberate engineering culture.

Engineering culture is the one ingredient that is uniquely within the control of the engineering organization and its participants. 

It needs to be deliberately crafted, documented, exercised and most importantly, safeguarded from other externalities to the engineering process and organization.

- We believe software engineering culture is equally as important as the actual engineering of software itself. 	
 	
- We believe a set of standards should describe some minimums that underpin a healthy, effective and sustainable software engineering organization.
 	
- We believe that engineering culture involves more than just software engineering; including the relationship with the product organization; the relationship with senior management – all of these are facets relevant to a healthy engineering culture

## Principles
### 1. Engineering culture is a distinct, quantifiable quality

 ##### i. Safeguard engineering culture as a distinct responsibility
   - It should be one or more people's responsibility to deliberately monitor,influence and track the culture of the organization
   
 ##### ii. Quality gates and guardrails protect engineering culture
   - Guardrails and quality gates must be installed to provide long-term safeguards for the culture of organization
   
 ##### iii. Measure engineering culture along predefined guardrails and quality gates
   - Guardrails and quality gates will offer the best opportunities to observe the culture
   
 ##### iv. Autopilot wherever possible and practical
   - Put as many guardrails as you can on autopilot - a system of checks and balances that can self-direct.

### 2. [Engineers own how the product is built](content/build.md)

 ##### 1. Understand the quality gates available to you
   - Be aware of the stages your product goes through. They are opportunities to improve the quality and security of your product
   
 ##### 2.2 Building the product should be as straightforward as you can make it
   - You build it; you own it. You deserve the most frictionless engineering experience you can create for yourself
   
 ##### 2.3 Supporting the product should be as straightforward as you can make it 
   - You build it; you own it. Make supporting the product as comfortable as you can for yourself
   
 ##### 2.4 Testing the product should be as straightforward as you can make it
   - You build it; you own it. The business deserves guarantees of the quality of the product. Make it easy for yourself
   
 ##### 2.5 Upgrading the product should be as straightforward as you can make it 
   - You build it; you own it; expect your product to change as the business landscape changes. Make the changes easy for yourself
   
 ##### 2.6 Build the product to tell you what went wrong and how
   - You build it; you own it. Spend as little time as possible wondering what went wrong or how
   
 ##### 2.7 Shift the guardrails as leftward as you can make them
   - Do more to guardrail the quality of your product in earlier quality gates. You'll have less to do later when it's more costly
   
 ##### 2.8 Don't shrinkwrap your product
   - Requirements will change; timelines will change; avoid hard forks and prepare for your design to take a punch
   
 ##### 2.9 Seek the feedback of your customers and partners at key quality gates
   - Keep everyone informed; cover your rear
   
 ##### 2.10 Be loud or be wrong, never both
   - Either be absolutely, objectively, verifiably correct; or don't speak in absolutes

### 3. [Leadership supports how the product is built ](content/grow.md)
 ##### i. Actively manage scope, capacity and timelines
   - Nothing will burn your engineers or leadership out faster than shifting scopes, capacity and timelines
   
 ##### ii. Actively engineer context sharing
   - Everyone should know why they're doing what they're doing; clarify the connection between the past, present and future
   
 ##### iii. Actively engineer communication loops
   - Everyone should know how things are going; you should know how things are going
   
 ##### iv. Actively manage goals
   - Goals build muscle; muscle builds the organization
    
 ##### v. Actively engineer opportunities 
   - Goals without opportunities to deliver them are worthless
    
 ##### vi. Actively engineer skill-sets 
   - A team full of generalists will become costly; cultivate depth in the specific skill-sets your team needs, in line with their interests
   
 ##### vii. Actively manage delivery risk
   -  For everything that could negatively affect delivery and quality: document, communicate and mitigate.
   
 ##### viii. Actively engineer goodwill
   - Happy developer, happy life. Hard times will come, and go over easier when the team's usually in a generally in a good mood
   
 ##### ix. The Peter Principle is the enemy
   - Responsibility without adequate preparation for the responsibility is going to be disastrous 
   
 ##### x. Be loud or be wrong, never both
   - Either be absolutely, objectively, verifiably correct; or don't speak in absolutes

### 4. [Everyone supports their partners and customers](content/partner.md)
 ##### i. The business and engineering are in a partnership, not a "customership"
   - Partners are mutually obligated to each other and hold themselves accountable to predetermined expectations
   
 ##### ii Know your customers
   - You can't empathize with a customer you never hear from. You won't satisfy customers you don't empathize with
   
 ##### iii. Be loud or be wrong, never both
   - Either be absolutely, objectively, verifiably correct; or don't speak in absolutes
